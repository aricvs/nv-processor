A Python script to convert a WhatsApp job posting group message log into a CSV with the postings

Requires Pandas.

This takes all the job postings that were posted in the group "NÃ³ias de vagas", separates the values using Regex and other methods, and uses Pandas to organize the data and generate a .csv file.
